password complexity such as symbols and numbers can be easier for users to
remember without being predictable.

prevent this security risk, FortiGate is preconfigured to limit the number of failed
administrator login attempts. After the maximum number of failed login attempts is
reached, access to the account is blocked for the configured lockout period.

Default Value:
By default, the number of password retry attempts is set to three, allowing the
administrator a maximum of three attempts at logging in to their account before they are
locked out for a set amount of time (by default, 60 seconds).

Additional Information:
The number of attempts and the default wait time before the administrator can try to
enter a password again can be configured using the CLI.
A maximum of ten retry attempts can be configured, and the lockout period can be 1 to
2147483647 seconds (over 68 years).
The higher the retry attempts, the higher the risk that someone might be able to guess
the password.","When you log in and fail to enter the correct password, you could potentially be a valid

limiting the number of failed login attempts before a lockout period in which you cannot
